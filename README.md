# Mathematical-Optimization-for-Route-Planning-
Route planning is a classic problem in operations research and computer science .It is used to find the most effective path b/w two points , considering various constraints such as distance, time, cost etc. The project focuses on the following key components: Graph Representation, Shortest Path Algorithms, Mathematical Optimization, Visualization.
